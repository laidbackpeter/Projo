				The reality of the matter is that a shooting can happen anywhere at any time. And if you are unfortunate enough to find yourself in the same place as a shooter, whether you're at school or in a workplace, it's best to be prepared. If you can run away reasonably safely, that should always be your first move. If not, you need to hide and barricade yourself. And if you come face to face with a shooter, then you will need to fight for your life. If you want to know how to survive a school or workplace shooting, follow these steps.
			</p>

			<h1>Method 1 of 4: Running Away</h1>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method1Pic1.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>1</h2>
				Decide if you should run, hide, or fight. If you are able to run away from the shooter in a reasonable amount of time, then it's time to start running as fast as you can. Though you may freeze and be too scared to do anything, remind yourself that runners have the highest survival rate in a shooting. If you can't run away because the shooter is too close or because you're responsible for a group of small children, for example, then you should decide whether you have enough time to barricade yourself in a room before you hide.
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you don't have time to barricade yourself, then worry about hiding.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the shooter attacks you, you'll have to fight him -- this will be your only chance at survival. Read below to find out how
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>

				<h2>2</h2>
				Run away if you can. If you hear shots in the distance but feel that you can run or escape reasonably safely, then it should be time to plan your escape path. Though you may freeze when you hear the sound of bullets, you need to be able to react immediately and see if running is your best option. Runners have a higher success rate in shootings than people who hide, so if you feel that the shooter is far enough away for you to make a run for it, then now is your chance.
				<ul>
					<li>
						If the shooter is in close proximity to you, whether he's running up the hall or outside your door, then skip to the next section to look out for tactics for hiding.
					</li>
					<li>
						Reacting immediately is crucial to this situation, whether you're running or hiding. Don't freeze up and delay your reaction. This may not give you enough time to run away even though that may be your best option. Freezing can force you to end up hiding, which may not be your best move.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method1Pic3.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>3</h2>
				Run in a zig-zag pattern or crouch down as you run. Though your first instinct will be to run straight ahead, since you'll be running for your life, you should run in a zig-zag pattern to minimize your chances of being shot. If the shooter approaches at a distance and aims his gun at you, you'll be harder to shoot if you're not running in a straight path that gives him enough time to aim his gun. You can also crouch down as you run so it's more difficult to shoot you.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Run as fast as you can and try to run in a zig-zag pattern or crouch at the same time. But if this is slowing you down or disorienting you, just run forward.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method1Pic4.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>4</h2>
				Forget your belongings. If you've determined that it's best to run, then forget your wallet, your purse, or your cell phone. Though your first instinct may be to take your possessions with you, none of them are as important as your life.

			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method1Pic5.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>5</h2>
				Bring people with you. As you're running, encourage others to run. If someone looks disoriented or too scared to move, grab that person and drag him with you. Tell the people that running is crucial to your survival. If you're running in a bigger group, it'll be harder to target you individually, and you'll have strength in numbers if you do run up against the shooter.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method1Pic6.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>6</h2>
				Cover your tracks if you can. If you have the time, grab a fire extinguisher and create a path of smoke behind you so the shooter will have a harder time pursuing you. Keep the extinguisher and other sharp objects that can be used as weapons if you face the shooter. But don't waste time looking for weapons or ways to cover your tracks if it'll keep you from escaping.
			</p>

			<h1>Method 2 of 4:  Hiding and Barricading Yourself</h1>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method2Pic1.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>1</h2>
				Determine if you should hide and barricade yourself. It should only take a few seconds to determine if your best course of action should be to run or to hide. If the shooter is rapidly approaching the room you're in, then you should prepare to hide as soon as possible. If you have more time, but not enough time to run, then you should barricade yourself and call the authorities before you hide. If you need to hide and have time to barricade yourself and there are multiple people in the room, you should delegate tasks:
				<ul>
					<li>
						One person or group of people should lock and barricade the door.
					</li>
					<li>
						One person or group of people should call 9-1-1.
					</li>
					<li>
						One person or group of people should grab all the weapons he can find.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method2Pic2.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>2</h2>
				Turn off the lights. Immediately turn off the lights in the room where you are. This will disorient the shooter and make it look less likely that there are people in the room where you are.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method2Pic3.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>3</h2>
				Lock and barricade the door. Lock the door immediately and do anything you can to make it more difficult for the shooter to enter. Remember that most shooters only have a few minutes before the police show up, and they're not interested in taking the path of most resistance. Lock the door, place a doorstop on it, and place all heavy furniture like desks and chairs in front of the door immediately to deter the shooter. If the shooter is approaching, get away from the door as soon as you can to keep yourself from being shot through the door.
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you're in a bathroom that doesn't lock, use a belt or t-shirt to tie the metal latches on top of the door that allow it to open and close.
					</li>
					<li>
						Once you've locked and barricaded the door, stay away from the door and all windows immediately.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method2Pic4.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>4</h2>
				Call 9-1-1. If there's a landline in the room, pick it up and call 9-1-1 immediately. Using a landline instead of your cell phone is the best move because the police will automatically be able to trace the call, which they would not be able to do if you called from your cell phone.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method2Pic5.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>5</h2>
				Grab any weapons you can find. Look around the room where you're hiding and find anything that you can use as a weapon. It can be a stapler or sharp scissors you find in the teacher's desk, the hot coffee in the kitchen of your office, beakers in a science room, or anything that is sharp, heavy, made of glass, or which can be used as a weapon. Hold on to these weapons in the event that the shooter enters the room where you are.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method2Pic6.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>6</h2>
				Hide. Once you've grabbed your weapons, it's time to hide under desks, chairs, in closets, or in any hiding places that are convenient. No matter where you hide, you should stay low to the ground to make yourself less of a target. If you have time, turn off your cell phone so the sound won't encourage the shooter to approach you.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method2Pic7.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>7</h2>
				Try to stay calm. Though this may seem nearly impossible, it's crucial that you stay absolutely silent. Tell people that whimpering or crying will only make the shooter more likely to find you. Be mentally prepared for the event that the shooter comes into the room and finds you. In that case, you'll have no choice but to fight.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method2Pic8.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>8</h2>
				Consider playing dead if you can't hide yourself. This only works if shots have been fired and you're already in a room or place when people have been shot and have no place to hide. Then, if the shooter approaches your location, you can take a risk and play dead, hoping that he'll think that you're among the dead and will pass you by. However, this is a risky move because he may not believe you're dead, and you may be too nervous to stay completely still.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method2Pic9.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>9</h2>
				Wait. Once you've hid and barricaded yourself, all you can do is wait for the police to arrive and save you, or wait for the shooter to approach, in which case you'll have to hide. When the police arrive do not run to them or request help, as this may cause them to think you are a threat. Do exactly what the officers tell you to do, do it quickly, and do it without argument or protest. Be as helpful as possible to the authorities. Tell them everything you know.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method2Pic10.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>10</h2>
				Remember that attacking the shooter is your final option. You shouldn't jump out of your hiding place and attack the shooter if he's approaching. You should only fight him if you're sure that you'll be shot if you do nothing.
			</p>
			<h1>Method 3 of 4: Attacking the Shooter</h1>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method3Pic1.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>1</h2>
				Do not try to reason with the shooter or plead for your life. Trying to engage with the shooter, ask him what he's doing, or to plead for your life by talking about your family has not been proven effective in dealing with shooters. The shooter will be on a rampage and will be beyond hearing the voice of reason, so don't waste your time by trying to talk to him -- you're much better off fighting.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method3Pic2.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>2</h2>
				If there are multiple people in the room, ambush the shooter. If there are multiple people in the room and he can see all of them, then you should all try to attack him at once, hurting him, throwing objects, and doing everything you can to render him powerless. You may not want to fight the shooter if you see that someone else is doing it, but strength in numbers will make it more likely that you'll survive.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method3Pic3.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>3</h2>
				Attack the shooter with any weapon you can. Use your sharp scissors, glass, or any other sharp or heavy objects to attack the shooter immediately. Even a sharp ballpoint pen or pencil could be the perfect weapon for gouging out the shooter's eyes. You're fighting for your life and every second counts. Don't hesitate just because he has a gun and you don't.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method3Pic4.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>4</h2>
				Aim high. Try to hurt the shooter in the face, eyes, shoulders, or neck, or arms, so that he's more likely to let go of his weapon. You should stab him in the neck, gouge out his eyes, or stab him in the arm -- doing anything you can to make him get rid of that weapon or to hurt him so the weapon is within your reach.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Kick him in the crotch. If you can't go for his face or weapon, kick him in the crotch. This will be an effective way to disarm him and to cause him a large amount of pain.
					</li>
				</ul>

			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/Method3Pic5.jpg" width="100%">
				<h2>5</h2>
				Don't think about being shot. Focus on fighting for your life, knowing that most people who are shot by a gun actually survive. Stay strong and fight for your life with everything you've got instead of worrying about the worst-case scenario. This may sound nearly impossible, but this is the best thing you can do if you want to survive the shooting.
			</p>

			<h1>Method 4 of 4: Preventing or Preparing for a School or Workplace Shooting</h1>
			<p>

				<h2>1</h2>
				Report any suspicious activity. Keep alert and always report suspicious incidents to the authorities. If a student or co-worker talks about killing people or threatens to bring a knife or a gun to school, report this to a teacher or law enforcement. You may prevent a disaster by doing so. Many shooters often announce their plans ahead of schedule as a way of showing off; do not take their behavior lightly or as a joke and report it immediately.
			</p>
			<p>

				<h2>2</h2>
				Be aware of your school or workplace's lockdown procedure. Every school and office has some kind of lockdown procedure that stipulates how doors should be locked, where people should hide, and how the authorities should be called, so if you'd like to be prepared for a shooting, be familiar with your workplace's standard procedure when it comes to shootings. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to follow protocol exactly in the event of a shooting, but knowing what it is can help you react in the most helpful way possible.
			</p>
			<p>

				<h2>3</h2>
				Be prepared for a shooting. Though you should not bring a weapon to school or to the workplace just in case there is a shooting, if you'd really like to be prepared, you should take self-defense classes or other classes that teach you how to fight off an attacker in the event of an attack or shooting. Knowing a few fighting tricks can help you feel more confident in the event that you have no choice but to attack a shooter.
